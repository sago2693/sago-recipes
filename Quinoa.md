## Ingredients

Serves: 3

- 1 cup quinoa
let's see if it makes 3 serves. Maybe 1.25 cups would be better
## Method: instantpot
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 cup vegetable stock. Too dry, I need 1.5 cups. With 1.25 cups quinoa I would need 1.75 cups vegetable stock


## Instructions:

1. Pressure cook on high
2. natural release for 8 minutes

First attempt to see if it doesn't become too dry
