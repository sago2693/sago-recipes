## Ingredients

Serves: 4

- Let's try 2 small onions chopped
- Alleged 1/4 cup  red lentils per serve. let's try. This time I'll try 1 full cup
- 3 cups water (stovetop)
- I'll try 2 red bell pepper


## Method: Stovetop with electric pot
## Instructions:
1. If onion available, saute with butter.
2. Place lentils and water in pot with onion. Heat until boil
3. Add bell pepper
4. Reduce heat and continue to cook for somewhere for 6-7 minutes
5. Unfortunately, the lentils get open too quickly. Probably it is not suitable to do with the electric pot, as it is better to lower the temperature after boiling.
